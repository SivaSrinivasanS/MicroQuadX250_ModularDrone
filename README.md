# MicroQuad-X250: Modular Educational Quadcopter Platform

**An educational-grade modular UAV designed for hands-on learning, serviceability, and cost-effective deployment in STEM environments.**

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The **MicroQuad-X250** is a 250mm diagonal-span quadcopter engineered to support modular, repeatable assembly and educational accessibility. The design emphasizes:

- **Component-level modularity** for repair and learning  
- **Single-tool assembly** for ease of use (2.5mm hex key)  
- **3-year classroom lifecycle** (500+ assembly cycles)  
- **Optimized cost structure** for educational deployment  

This repository contains all project documentation, design visuals, and support materials for showcasing the platform in professional, academic, or prototyping environments.
